**Introduction.**

Hello there, my name is Kendall White. I wanted to create a simple full stack application. Then, feature it within my profile to attract job prospects. I used what I picked up from my degree program and with a little bit of googling, I was able to find what I was looking for in terms of standard best practices. 

**Side note.**

If there is anything I can do better that was displayed within this project please, let me know. I am very open to feedback!

**Motivation.**

I wanted to get my feet wet in UI/UX design as well as creating a database to store the user’s information. I figured the best way to get better at development/engineering is to find practical use cases to work on my skills. I am on the hunt for my first shot at becoming a software engineer/ developer. I am currently wrapping up my degree program at Southern New Hampshire University. I will be finished with my bachelor’s this December. 

**Why was this created?**

After the user logs in or lands on a webpage. If they wanted to get in contact with me or the company, they can do so effortlessly with the contact form. This was created to give user’s a voice and to reach out with any questions.

**What does it do?**

This simple application takes input from the user and stores the information within a MySQL database for later usage. The application also features the good ol’ hover effect for the button. This gives the user a call to action. In other words, they will know it is an actual button because when hovered over.

**Tools and technologies used.** 
Java – Used to create the logic within how to contact form is supposed to work.
HTML – This structures the webpage with plain old paragraphs
CSS – Styling a webpage is important now a days. I used this tool to customize the layout to the user’s liking. 
MySQL – Information that is saved from the user will be uploaded to the database. This gives me, the developer the option to view the information later.
IntelliJ Idea – With an integrated database within the IDE, this has made working with MYSQL much easier. I can connect to the database right from the IDE!
Canva – UI/UX designs were created here. I needed a free option to incorporate my design knowledge for how the application must resemble. 
Google – Googling is for everyone. Even seniors… believe it or not…
